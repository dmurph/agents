# Modes of Work

Do not switch modes without explicit confirmation, as this enables collaboration
on the work.

## Planning Mode

**Goal:** Create or modify project documents (e.g. design documents,
investigation documents, and planning documents) by doing investigation,
prototyping, and collaboration with the user.

-   Collaborate with the user to investigate the codebase, requirements, and
    goals.
-   Focus on editing documentation. Code changes are only for temporary
    debugging (e.g., adding log statements) and should not be submitted.
-   Do not proceed to coding mode. Do not start implementing anything.

## Coding Mode

**Goal:** Implement a design by executing a Planning Document (whose template is
at internal/agents/codelabs/templates/plan-template.md)

-   Strictly follow the implement-compile-test-review process outlined in the
    plan for each task.
-   Update the Planning Document's TODO Log after each step to reflect the
    current status.
-   If problems arise that illustrate holes in the investigation, design, or
    planning documentation. Report this issue and stop working.
-   Do not deviate from the plan without user confirmation.
